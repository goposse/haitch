# Features

- Full featured, but none of the bloat
- Easy to understand, Builder-based architecture
- `Request` / `Response` injection allowing for "plug-in" functionality
- Extensible `Response` interface so you can design for whatever specific response your app requires


# Swift version

Haitch `0.7+` and `development` require swift 2.2+. If you're using a version of swift < 2.2, you should use Haitch version `0.6`.


# Installation

## CocoaPods

Add the following line to your `Podfile`:

`pod 'Haitch', '~> 0.7'`

Then run `pod update` or `pod install` (if starting from scratch).

## Carthage

Add the following line to your `Cartfile`:

`github "goposse/haitch" ~> 0.7`

Run `carthage update` and then follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).


# The basics

Making a request is easy

```swift
let httpClient: HttpClient = HttpClient()
let req: Request = Request.Builder()
  .url(url: "http://my.domain.com/path", params: params)
  .method("GET")
  .build()

httpClient.execute(req) { (response: Response?, error: NSError?) -> Void in
  // deal with the response data (NSData) or error (NSError)
}
```

## JSON

Getting back JSON is simple

```swift
client.execute(request: req, responseKind: JsonResponse.self) {
  (response, error) -> Void in
    if let jsonResponse: JsonResponse = response as? JsonResponse {
      print(jsonResponse.json)      // .json == AnyObject?
    }
  }
```

# Custom Responses

If you use SwiftyJSON you could create a custom Response class to convert the `Response` data to the `JSON` data type. It's very easy to do so.

```swift
import Foundation
import SwiftyJSON

public class SwiftyJsonResponse: Response {

  private (set) public var json: JSON?
  private (set) public var jsonError: AnyObject?

  public convenience required init(response: Response) {
    self.init(request: response.request, data: response.data, statusCode: response.statusCode,
        error: response.error)
  }

  public override init(request: Request, data: NSData?, statusCode: Int, error: NSError?) {
    super.init(request: request, data: data, statusCode: statusCode, error: error)
    self.populateJSONWithResponseData(data)
  }

  private func populateJSONWithResponseData(data: NSData?) {
    if data != nil {
      var jsonError: NSError? = nil
      let json: JSON = JSON(data: data!, options: .AllowFragments, error: &jsonError)
      self.jsonError = jsonError
      self.json = json
    }
  }

}
```

# FAQ

## Why is there no `sharedClient` (or some such)?

Because it's about your needs and not what we choose for you. You should both understand AND be in control of your network stack. If you feel strongly about it, subclass `HttpClient` and add it yourself. Simple.


## Why should I use this?

It's up to you. There are other fantastic frameworks out there but, in our experience, we only need a small subset of the things they do. The goal of Haitch was to allow you to write modular, reusable notworking logic that matches your specific requirements. Not to deal with the possiblity of "what if?".

## Has it been tested in production? Can I use it in production?

The code here has been written based on Posse's experiences with clients of all sizes. It has been production tested. That said, this incarnation of the code is our own. It's fresh. We plan to use it in production and we plan to keep on improving it. If you find a bug, let us know!
